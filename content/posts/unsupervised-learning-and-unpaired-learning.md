title: Unsupervised Learning vs. Unpaired Learning, or Is GAN Unsupervised?
best: true

Recently, I was asked a question: what is unsupervised training and what is unpaired training? Are they the same or are they different? More related problem will be: does GAN belong to unsupervised methods?

In this post, I want to discuss this interesting and important problem.
